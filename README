To setup this PSC pipeline, unzip it and put it in a folder and change the environmental variables in your
.bashrc or .bash_profile:

export PATH="/home/zzhang6/Software/PSC_Pipeline/scripts:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/home/zzhang6/Software/PSC_Pipeline$PYTHONPATH"

Now you should be able to run commands in the example folder.
